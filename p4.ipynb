    "    - **retreats**: a phase that happens when some units (called **disloged units**) need to retreat. If they can't, they are destroyed\n",

    "- Geographically, the game is divided into **provinces**\n",
    "- some provinces are called **supply centers** (SCS) and to win a **player** must control 18 supply centers.\n",
    "- Each **unit** belongs to a **player** and there can be **only 1 unit** in a province at a time, however **units** can join their force with **support order**.\n",
    "- There are 2 types of **units**:  {'F' or 'A'} for {Fleet, Army}\n",
