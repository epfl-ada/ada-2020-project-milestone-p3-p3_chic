    "Let's follow the definitions given by the paper.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Act of hostility**: When a player invades another, or if a player supports an invasion to the other player's territory.\n",

    "**Friendship**: a relationship between two players spanning over 3 seasons containing at least 2 **consecutive and reciprocated** acts of friendships.\n",

    "- Each **seasons** is itself divided into several phases, called **turns** (therefore, a year is made of at least 2 turns, and not more than 5)\n",
    "    - **orders**: each player submit orders to all of its units (that can be **hold**, **move**, **support** or **convoy**)\n",
    "    - **retreats**: a phase that happens when some units (called **disloged units**) need to retreat. If they can't, they are destroyed\n",
    "    - **builds**: only happens after the *fall retreat*. Players gain control of SCS they are occupying.\n",
    "- Geographically, the game is divided into **provinces**\n",
    "- some provinces are called **supply centers** (SCS) and to win a **player** must control 18 supply centers.\n",
    "- Each **unit** belongs to a **player** and there can be **only 1 unit** in a province at a time, however **units** can join their force with **support order**.\n",
    "- There are 2 types of **units**:  {'F' or 'A'} for {Fleet, Army}\n",
