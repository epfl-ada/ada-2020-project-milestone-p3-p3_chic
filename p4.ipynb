    "- AoF = \"Act of friendship\"\n",
    "- AoH = \"Act of hostility\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of the algorithm is to consider series of AoFs that we calls '**bags of AoF**'. Those bags, with what separates them, is what to be analysed. Let's define 2 criteria, internal and external. \n",
    "\n",
    "a. **Internal criteria** that a bag of AOFs must verify (*internal* because it only depends on the AoFs only)\n",
    "- more than 2 acts emitted by the 2 countries\n",
    "- the overall time elapsed is longer than 1.5 years\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **External criteria** that a bag of AoFs must verify (*external* because the criteria depend on the AoHs that happened at the same time)\n",
    "- no AoH in the same time range\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each pair of countries** (*their friendship is represented by a column of the 'friendships' dataframe*): \n",
    "1. Find all AOFs that happened between them. Consider them as a bag of AoFs. \n",
    "2. Verify that this 'bag of acts of friendships' (BAOF) verifies the *internal criteria* mentioned above. If so, fill between the first season and the last season with '1's. Else, make sure '0' are placed at the season of interest. \n",
    "3. Find acts of hostility that happened between the same time range as the bag of words. Split the bag of words (*actually, it's the seasons array that is split*) for every act of hostility so that we obtain \n",
    "4. For each bag of AoF (hence, un-interupted by hostility, so external validity is verified !) verify again internal validity. If not verified, replace '1's with zeros.\n",
    "5. Find betrayal, as the event:  \"breaking a bags of AoFs with more than 1 hostile action\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's note that since the step 3 doesn't need to be repeated, it is not a recursive aglorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement this algorithm, we need a 'splitting' function which also is a little tricky. There are several ways to do this splitting properly (recursive spliting would be one way) but we will use a vectorized approach to do so. We want to split a list of 'ones' divided by zeros into a list of 'bags' of ones. Let's just show how one can do that here"

For instance the game '91 843' has 1002 orders that were passed and only '2' of them were considered as acts of friendships. We guess that there are two types of games: those with many alliances and betrayals, and those with more personal games and players not coordinating a lot.
