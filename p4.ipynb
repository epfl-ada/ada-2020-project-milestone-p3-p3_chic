    "- Each **seasons** is itself divided into several phases, called **turns** (therefore, a year is made of at least 2 turns, and not more than 5):\n",
    "    - **orders**: each player submit orders to all of its units (that can be **hold**, **move**, **support** or **convoy**)\n",
    "    - **retreats**: a phase that happens when some units (called **disloged units**) need to retreat. If they can't, they are destroyed\n",
    "    - **builds**: only happens after the *fall retreat*. Players gain control of SCS they are occupying.\n",
    "- Geographically, the game is divided into **provinces**\n",
    "- some provinces are called **supply centers** (SCS) and to win a **player** must control 18 supply centers.\n",
    "- Each **unit** belongs to a **player** and there can be **only 1 unit** in a province at a time, however **units** can join their force with **support order**.\n",
    "- There are 2 types of **units**:  {'F' or 'A'} for {Fleet, Army}\n",

    "- AoH = \"Act of hostility\"\n",

Let's define 2 criterias: one internal criteria and one external criteria that 'bags of AoF' must verify in order to be part of an actual friendship.\n",

    "a. **Internal criterion** that a bag of AOFs must verify (*internal* because it only depends on the AoFs only)\n",
    "- more than 2 acts emitted by the 2 countries\n",
    "- the overall time elapsed is longer than 1.5 years\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **External criterion** that a bag of AoFs must verify (*external* because the criteria depend on the AoHs that happened at the same time)\n",
    "- no AoH in the same time range\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each pair of countries** (*their friendship is represented by a column of the 'friendships' dataframe*): \n",
    "1. Find all AOFs that happened between them. Consider them as a bag of AoFs. \n",
    "2. Verify that this 'bag of acts of friendships' (BAOF) verifies the *internal criteria* mentioned above. If so, fill between the first season and the last season with '1's. Else, make sure '0' are placed at the season of interest. \n",
    "3. Find acts of hostility that happened between the same time range as the bag of words. Split the bag of words (*actually, it's the seasons array that is split*) for every act of hostility so that we obtain \n",
    "4. For each bag of AoF (hence, un-interupted by hostility, so external validity is verified !) verify again internal validity. If not verified, replace '1's with zeros.\n",
    "5. Find betrayal, as the event:  \"breaking a bags of AoFs with more than 1 hostile action\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's note that since the step 3 doesn't need to be repeated, it is not a recursive aglorithm. Recursives approach were also tried, but they turned to be a lot harder than this. \n",

    "Before implementing this algorithm, we need a 'splitting' function which also is a little tricky. There are several ways to do this splitting properly (recursive spliting would be one way) but we will use a vectorized approach to do so. **We want to split a list of 'ones' divided by zeros into a list of 'bags' of ones**. Let's just show how one can do that here using the power of **numpy**. "

    "We believe that given more time, we could have found better results. At least, we really could have tried a lot more. Indeed, the data-processing to find betrayals was extremely time consuming and since we also had to invest time writing the data story and the repport, we really didn't have many days working on the classifier. Here is a list of 'future plans' that we would have liked to do:\n",
    "- Like in what the authors of the paper did, ask ourself the question: **is it the case because some betrayals are detected too early ?** (*Actually, looking at the data we realize that it is probably not the case...*)\n",
    "- After looking at the prediction results, we noticed that the for a few games many betrayals are detected, so we must answer to the question: **how can we enforce that there's only one betrayal per game ?** Adding this constraint is likely to increase the learning of the classifier. \n",
    "- Design better features\n",
    "- Perform cross-validation for feature selection\n",
    "- Have a more complex classifier. After all, humans are not able to perform well at this task, so it would not be suprising that even after doing all the previous steps and investing a lot of time on them, we realize that a linear classifier isn't able to do that. "
