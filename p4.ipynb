    "    - **retreats**: a phase that happens when some units (called **disloged units**) need to retreat. If they can't, they are destroyed\n",

    "- Each **unit** belongs to a **player** and there can be **only 1 unit** in a province at a time, however **units** can join their force with **support order**.\n",
